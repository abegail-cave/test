	8.	tion of the depository institution, at the frequency other- 
	9.	wise required by law, verify the composition of the assets

	7.	outstanding payment stablecoins. The application shall 
	8.	also contain a draft customer agreement, flow of funds 
	9.	explanation, a robust information technology plan and 
	10.	operational design of the payment stablecoin. As applica- 
	11.	ble, the appropriate Federal banking agency or State bank 
	12.	supervisor shall render a decision on the application within

	2.	Upon the demand of a customer, a depository institution 
	3.	shall redeem an outstanding payment stablecoin at par in 
	4.	the coins, currency, or other instruments that are legal 
	5.	tender, as defined in section 5103 of title 31, United 
	6.	States Code, or the similar laws of the jurisdiction of the 
	7.	unit of account in which the payment stablecoin is denomi- 
	8.	nated or to which the value of the payment stablecoin is 
	9.	pegged. A depository institution may redeem a payment 
	10.	stablecoin issued by another depository institution at par, 
	11.	upon demand. The Board of Governors of the Federal Re-

	18.	(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
	19.	(1) Final settlement of transactions in central 
	20.	bank money reduces risk in the financial system, in- 
	21.	cluding through the reduction of counterparty expo- 
	22.	sure. 
	23.	(2) Digital assets settle with finality in seconds 
	24.	or minutes, whereas traditional financial trans- 
	25.	actions may take days to settle.
	1.	(3) This mismatch in the settlement window of 
	2.	digital assets and traditional financial assets creates 
	3.	risk in the economy that may be reduced through 
	4.	the ability of depository institutions to simulta- 
	5.	neously conduct digital asset transactions and settle, 
	6.	with finality, the United States dollar component of 
	7.	these transactions. 
	8.	(4) The Federal Reserve Act specifies that a 
	9.	depository institution, as defined in section 19(b)(1) 
	10.	of that Act (12 U.S.C. 461(b)(1)), upon receiving a 
	11.	charter from the Office of the Comptroller of the 
	12.	Currency, National Credit Union Administration or 
	13.	State bank supervisor, is required to be made avail- 
	14.	able services from Federal Reserve banks under sec- 
	15.	tion 11A of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 
	16.	248a), including currency and coin services, wire 
	17.	transfer services, automated clearinghouse services 
	18.	and settlement services. 
	19.	(5) Numerous Federal courts have found that 
	20.	the provision of services to depository institutions 
	21.	under section 11A of the Federal Reserve Act (12 
	22.	U.S.C. 248a) is a ministerial duty imposed by Con- 
	23.	gress with respect to all depository institutions. 
	24.	(6) The Board of Governors of the Federal Re- 
	25.	serve System has long interpreted the Federal Re- 
	1.	serve Act to mean that the Federal Reserve banks 
	2.	must provide services to all depository institutions, 
	3.	noting that it has a duty ‘‘to ensure the provision 
	4.	of payment services to all depository institutions on 
	5.	an equitable basis, and to do so in an atmosphere 
	6.	of competitive fairness’’. 
	7.	(7) The Federal Reserve banks have, on occa- 
	8.	sion, provided services to non-depository, non-in- 
	9.	sured institutions without appropriate statutory au- 
	10.	thority. 
	11.	(8) Certain novel legal positions that conflict 
	12.	with or frustrate these precedents are not in the best 
	13.	traditions of the Federal Reserve Act, our dual 
	14.	banking system, and the imperatives of Congress. 
	15.	(9) The statutory independence of the Board of 
	16.	Governors and the Federal Reserve banks under the 
	17.	Constitution of the United States is properly rooted 
	18.	in absolute fidelity to the laws enacted by Congress. 
	19.	(10) It is appropriate for Congress to reaffirm 
	20.	its existing statutory intent to ensure that all deposi- 
	21.	tory institutions may access services under the Fed- 
	22.	eral Reserve Act ‘‘on an equitable basis, and to do 
	23.	so in an atmosphere of competitive fairness’’. 
	1.	(b) PRICING OF SERVICES.—Section 11A of the Fed- 
	2.	eral Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 248a) is amended by adding 
	3.	at the end the following: 
	4.	‘‘(f) A Federal Reserve bank shall provide a seg- 
	5.	regated balance account to a depository institution upon 
	6.	the request of any institution that receives services under 
	7.	this section.’’.

	10.	INSTITUTIONS; CHARGES.—Section 13 of the Federal Re- 
	11.	serve Act (12 U.S.C. 342) is amended to read as follows:

	13.	from any of its member banks or other depository 
	14.	institutions, and from the United States, deposits of 
	15.	current funds in lawful money, national-bank notes, 
	16.	Federal reserve notes, or checks, and drafts, payable 
	17.	upon presentation or other items, and also, for col- 
	18.	lection, maturing notes and bills; or, solely for pur- 
	19.	poses of exchange or of collection, shall receive from 
	20.	other Federal Reserve banks deposits of current 
	21.	funds in lawful money, national-bank notes, or 
	22.	checks upon other Federal Reserve banks, and 
	23.	checks and drafts, payable upon presentation within 
	24.	its district or other items, and maturing notes and 
	25.	bills payable within its district; or, solely for the pur- 
	1.	poses of exchange or of collection, shall receive from 
	2.	any non-member bank or trust company or other de-

	10.	amount as the Board determines taking into account 
	11.	items in transit, services provided by the Federal 
	12.	Reserve bank, and other factors as the Board may 
	13.	deem appropriate: Provided further, That nothing in 
	14.	this or any other section of this Act shall be con- 
	15.	strued as prohibiting a member or nonmember bank 
	16.	or other depository institution from making reason- 
	17.	able charges, to be determined and regulated by the 
	18.	Board of Governors, but in no case to exceed 10 
	19.	cents per $100 or fraction thereof, based on the 
	20.	total of checks and drafts presented at any one time, 
	21.	for collection or payment of checks and drafts and 
	22.	remission therefor by exchange or otherwise; but no 
	23.	such charges shall be made against the Federal Re- 
	24.	serve banks.’’.

	20.	AND CERTAIN OTHER ENTITIES. 
	21.	(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
	22.	(1) The laws surrounding custody of financial 
	23.	assets is largely customary, uncodified, and poorly 
	24.	understood.
	1.	(2) Lack of uniformity amongst various juris- 
	2.	dictions’ laws relating to custody has largely not 
	3.	been addressed by regulators, can contribute to risk, 
	4.	and is producing uncertainty for innovators. 
	5.	(3) Codifying basic principles around custody of 
	6.	financial assets will reduce systemic risk, clearly de- 
	7.	fine the rights and duties of both custodian and cus- 
	8.	tomer, and contribute to a more uniform and effec- 
	9.	tive banking system. 
	10.	(b) DEFINITION.—In this section, the term ‘‘cus- 
	11.	tody’’ means the safekeeping, servicing and management 
	12.	of customer financial assets, including currency, securities 
	13.	and commodities, on an off-balance sheet basis. 
	14.	(c) CUSTODY.— 
	15.	(1) IN GENERAL.—Except as provided in para- 
	16.	graph (2), custody of financial assets is accom- 
	17.	plished by a bailment and established by a written 
	18.	customer agreement. Custody shall not be a fidu- 
	19.	ciary or trust activity unless the custodian is pro- 
	20.	viding substantial discretionary services with respect 
	21.	to an account, including through investment advice 
	22.	or investment discretion, and the custodian owes a 
	23.	customer a higher standard of care or duty with re- 
	24.	spect to the customer of that account. 
1 (2) EXCEPTION.—A custodian and customer
2 may establish a legal relationship other than a bail-
	1.	ment pursuant to a written customer agreement. 
	2.	(d) PROPER DOCUMENTATION.—A custodial account 
	3.	shall be properly documented in a customer agreement, 
	4.	with a clearly defined legal relationship between the custo- 
	5.	dian and customer. Custodial assets shall be properly iden- 
	6.	tified and segregated from the assets of the custodian, 
	7.	with proper documentation of asset segregation. 
	8.	(e) NOT ASSETS OR LIABILITIES.—Assets properly 
	9.	held in a custodial account under this section are not as- 
	10.	sets or liabilities of the custodian and shall be maintained 
	11.	on an off-balance sheet basis, including for the purpose 
	12.	of accounting treatment for the custodian and the cus- 
	13.	tomers of the custodian, notwithstanding the form in 
	14.	which the assets are maintained. 
	15.	(f) APPLICABILITY.—This section shall apply to de- 
	16.	pository institutions, as defined in section 19(b)(1) of the
